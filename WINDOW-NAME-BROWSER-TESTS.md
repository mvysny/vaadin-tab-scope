# `window.name` preservation — manual browser test matrix

Test plan for [issue #2](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-tab-scope/issues/2): confirm, across real
browsers, **when a browser preserves `window.name` and when it drops it**. Tab identity — hence the
whole survive-F5/navigation guarantee — rests on the browser keeping `window.name` stable for the
lifetime of a physical tab. When it silently drops it, the same tab reads as a *new* tab (scope
resets) and the old scope orphans and is reaped, which a `addDestroyListener` consumer sees as a
**spurious destroy**.

This is only testable across real browsers — Karibu can simulate the *consequence* of a changed
name (`TabIdentityTest`) but cannot measure which browser/action actually drops it. Run this matrix
by hand and record the results under **[Last Testing Outcome](#last-testing-outcome)** at the bottom,
then fold the confirmed findings into README (INTERNALS "Tab identity fragility").

The file has two halves: everything above the "Last Testing Outcome" heading is the stable **test
definition** (how to run, what to observe, the scenarios). That half is edited only when the harness
or scenarios change. The bottom half is the **latest run** — overwrite it wholesale each time the
matrix is re-run; only the most recent run is kept.

---

## 1. Run the harness

The baked-in `testapp` is a complete harness — no code changes needed.

```bash
# dev mode (Vite dev server, hot reload); app on http://localhost:8080
./gradlew :testapp:run
```

Leave this terminal visible — **the server console is one of the three observable signals** (see
below). Library lifecycle events are already logged at `debug` in
`testapp/src/main/resources/simplelogger.properties`, so no extra config is needed.

For a run closer to what a real user hits (no dev server, minified frontend):

```bash
./gradlew :testapp:run -Pvaadin.productionMode
```

### Transport: plain HTTP is enough — no HTTPS needed

The harness serves plain **HTTP on port 8080**; **none** of the scenarios below require HTTPS.
`window.name` preservation, bfcache, session/crash restore, and Vaadin push (WebSocket) all work
over plain HTTP, and no row depends on a browser "secure context".

- **Desktop (B1–B4):** point the browser at **`http://localhost:8080`**. `localhost` is treated as
  a secure context by every browser even over plain HTTP, so nothing is gated.
- **Mobile / another machine (B5, B6):** there is no `localhost` on the device — use the harness
  machine's LAN address, **`http://<host-ip>:8080`** (find it with `ip addr` / `ifconfig`; both
  devices on the same network). A LAN IP over HTTP is *not* a secure context, but again no test row
  needs one, so this is fine. If a corporate network blocks it, an `ngrok`/Cloudflare tunnel
  (which gives an `https://…` URL) also works and changes nothing in the results.
- **Watch for silent HTTPS upgrades.** If a browser has "HTTPS-Only mode" / "Always use secure
  connections" on, or the host has ever sent HSTS, it may auto-upgrade `http://…:8080` to `https`
  and fail to connect. Disable HTTPS-only for the test host, or use the tunnel URL. HSTS is not an
  issue for a fresh `localhost` over plain HTTP.
- The cross-origin hop (S7) navigates to `https://example.com` — that page being HTTPS is
  irrelevant to the app's transport; the app stays on HTTP.

Run the whole matrix once per browser. For a clean baseline between browsers, either use a fresh
private/incognito window or clear the site for `localhost:8080` (this drops the `JSESSIONID`, so a
fresh Vaadin session — and fresh `Value` counter — starts).

### Automating a pass (Playwright / headless Chrome)

Most rows can be driven from Playwright (or any DevTools-protocol driver) against headless
Chromium, which is a fast way to smoke-test the Chrome chapter and the harness itself. Read all
three signals per row with one `page.evaluate`:

```js
() => ({
  windowName: window.name,
  tabId: document.body.innerText.match(/Browser tab ID: (\S+)/)?.[1],
  value:  document.body.innerText.match(/Value: (\d+)/)?.[1],
})
```

| Row | How to drive it | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| S0  | open a 2nd tab, navigate it to `/` | expect a distinct `windowName` + `Value` |
| S1  | `location.reload()` | true F5 |
| S2a | `page.goto(location.href)` | programmatic same-URL reload — **the only half of S2 that automates** |
| S4  | click a SideNav link, then click back | |
| S5  | `document.location = location.href` | |
| S6  | `page.goBack()` / `page.goForward()` | |
| S7  | `page.goto('https://example.com')` then `page.goBack()` | needs outbound network |
| S9  | `window.open('http://localhost:8080/tab-scoped-route')` | new tab → fresh name |
| S13 | link away same-origin, then `page.goBack()` | bfcache restore |
| S14 | open `/preserve`, `location.reload()` | |

**Strictly manual — hand-run these in a real browser.** Each is human-only for a concrete reason.
Two of them (**S8**, S10) are blocked purely by a **missing Playwright MCP tool**; the rest are
browser-*chrome* or browser-*lifecycle* actions that no page-automation surface reaches — not the
MCP, and not raw Playwright/CDP either, so a new MCP tool alone wouldn't unblock them.

- **S2b** (address-bar Enter) — the URL bar is browser chrome, not page DOM. No MCP tool targets it,
  and even raw Playwright/CDP can't type into the omnibox; `browser_navigate` is a *programmatic*
  goto (that's S2a), a different code path that never trips the Safari drop.
- **S3** (bookmark click) — bookmarks live in browser chrome; no MCP tool, and no Playwright/CDP API
  creates or clicks them.
- **S8** (Duplicate Tab) — **missing MCP tool:** `browser_tabs` offers new/select/close/list but no
  *duplicate*. (Underlying CDP has no duplicate-target either — `Target.createTarget` only opens a
  *fresh* tab, i.e. S0/S9 — so this one stays manual until such a tool exists.) The user drives it
  by right-clicking the tab; the driver can only inspect the resulting tabs afterward.
- **S10** (reopen-closed-tab, Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-T) — **missing MCP tool** for the browser's
  reopen-closed-tab command; it's a chrome/history action, and `browser_press_key` sends keys to the
  *page*, not to browser chrome, so the shortcut can't be synthesized.
- **S11** (restore-after-quit) — needs a full **quit + relaunch with session restore**. The MCP owns
  the browser lifecycle and exposes no quit-and-relaunch tool; performing it would end the
  automation session, so it can't be scripted from within one.
- **S12** (restore-after-crash) — needs **force-killing the browser process** then choosing Restore.
  Same lifecycle problem as S11, and killing the MCP-managed browser kills the driver with it.

**Two caveats that make automation a smoke test, not a substitute:**

1. **Headless Chrome preserves `window.name` across every scriptable navigation** (`goto`,
   `reload`, `goBack`). So an automated pass confirms the *happy path* and that the harness/signals
   react, but it **cannot reproduce a name drop** — the whole point of S2b/S3. The Safari failure in
   particular is unreachable from headless Chrome and must be hand-run in real Safari (see the
   Safari modifier in §3).
2. **The programmatic reload (S2a) is a different code path from the human address-bar Enter
   (S2b).** That is exactly why S2 is split: `page.goto(location.href)` (S2a) always preserves the
   name in Chromium and is what automation can reach; a real address-bar Enter (S2b) is what trips
   Safari and only a human can perform it. An automated S2a pass says nothing about S2b.

### Browsers to cover (issue #2)

| # | Browser | Platform | How to reach it |
|---|---------|----------|-----------------|
| B1 | Chrome | desktop | — |
| B2 | Firefox | desktop | — |
| B3 | Edge | desktop | — |
| B4 | Safari | macOS desktop | record **two chapters**: Web Inspector closed *and* open (known modifier) |
| B5 | Safari | iOS/iPadOS | use a LAN URL `http://<host-ip>:8080` or a tunnel; iOS has no localhost |
| B6 | Chrome | Android | optional; same LAN-URL note |

---

## 2. The three observable signals

Every scenario is read off the same three signals. **Signal C (the server log) is the ground
truth** — it prints the exact `window.name` the server received and every scope create/orphan/reap.

**A. Drawer — "Browser tab ID: `<windowName>`".** In the AppLayout drawer (open the hamburger /
DrawerToggle if collapsed). This is the raw `window.name` as the server saw it via
`ExtendedClientDetails`. *If this string changes for the same physical tab, the browser dropped
`window.name`.*

**B. View body — "Value: `N`".** A per-tab-scope counter, seeded **once** when a scope is created.
- Stays the **same** number → same scope survived (name preserved). ✅
- Jumps to a **new** number → a new scope was created (name lost, or genuinely a new tab). ⚠️

**C. Server console.** The library logs (package `com.github.mvysny.vaadin.tabscope`, debug):
- `Created TabScope{<windowName>}` — a new scope was seeded for this name.
- `TabScope{<windowName>} is now orphaned ...` — its last UI went away; grace clock (~60 s) armed.
- `Destroying TabScope{<windowName>}` — the scope was reaped. **After a name-loss this is the
  spurious destroy** the issue is about.

> Reading the pair: a name-preserving reload logs **no** new `Created` and keeps the same `Value`.
> A name-*dropping* reload logs a `Created TabScope{<newName>}` immediately, and ~60 s later a
> `Destroying TabScope{<oldName>}` (the old scope orphaning out) — that delayed destroy is the
> false-positive a tab-close consumer must not confuse with a real close.

### Routes to use

| Route | URL | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Main View | `/` | prototype route + tab-scoped `Value` — default for most rows |
| Tab Scoped View | `/tab-scoped-route` | `@TabScoped` cached instance — cross-check caching survives too |
| @PreserveOnRefresh View | `/preserve` | `@PreserveOnRefresh` path — the beacon-hook / no-reset-on-F5 case |

The SideNav also shows two **"(No App Layout)"** variants — `/main-view-no-app-layout` and
`/tab-scoped-route-no-app-layout` — the same views rendered without the `AppLayout` wrapper. They
are **not required** for the matrix (tab scoping is independent of the layout), but are handy to
cross-check a "preserved"/"dropped" verdict on a page that isn't wrapped in `AppLayout`. Signal A's
"Browser tab ID" is drawn in the `AppLayout` drawer, so on these variants read the verdict off
signals B (`Value`) and C (server log) instead.

---

## 3. Scenarios and steps

The scenarios under test, each with its **expected** (correct) behavior and the exact steps to run
it. Outcomes are not recorded here — they go under [Last Testing Outcome](#last-testing-outcome),
one chapter per browser. Read an outcome as **preserved** when the `Value` is unchanged and no new
`Created` appears; **dropped** when the `Value` jumps, a `Created TabScope{...}` fires at once, and
a `Destroying TabScope{...}` follows ~60 s later. "Expected = new scope" entries are not bugs — the
point there is to confirm it's a genuine new tab.

Each entry leads with its expected verdict. The harness must be running and you start on
`http://localhost:8080/`; **before each scenario** note the current `Value` (signal B) and the
`Browser tab ID` (signal A), run the action, then compare and glance at the server console
(signal C).

- **S0 — Control (proves the harness reacts).** *Expected: new scope — distinct tab ID + `Value`.*
  With `/` open, open a second browser tab and go to `http://localhost:8080/`; a fresh
  `Created TabScope{...}` should appear in the log. This confirms distinct tabs really get distinct
  scopes; every "preserved" entry below is meaningful only relative to this.

- **S1 — Plain reload.** *Expected: preserved.* Press **F5** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd-R** (macOS).
  Same `Value`, same tab ID, **no** new `Created`.

- **S2a — Programmatic same-URL reload (automation only).** *Expected: preserved on every browser.*
  From a driver, run `page.goto(location.href)` (or navigate the tab to the same URL). This is the
  happy path a headless pass can reach; it does *not* reproduce the Safari drop (that's S2b). A
  human running the matrix by hand skips S2a and does S2b instead.

- **S2b — Address-bar reload (human only).** *Expected: preserved — except Safari, which drops it
  (see the S2b/S3 note below).* Click into the address bar (or Cmd/Ctrl-L), leave the URL
  unchanged, press **Enter**. *This is the known Safari failure path* — Safari 18.3.1 with Web
  Inspector **closed** drops `window.name` here (new `Value` + new `Created`); record that as
  `fails`. No automation can perform this — it is the real keyboard action in browser chrome.

- **S3 — Bookmark reload (human only).** *Expected: preserved — except Safari, which drops it (see
  the S2b/S3 note below).* Bookmark `http://localhost:8080/` once. Then, in the same tab, click the
  bookmark. Same failure as S2b.

- **S4 — In-app navigation.** *Expected: preserved.* Click a SideNav entry (e.g. "Tab Scoped
  View"), then click back to "Main View" (or use browser Back). Router navigation stays within one
  document. Cross-check on `/tab-scoped-route` that the `@TabScoped` instance's `Value` is stable
  too.

- **S5 — JS-driven navigation.** *Expected: preserved.* Open DevTools console and run
  `document.location = location.href`. (On Safari, note this is *with* Web Inspector open — see the
  modifier below.)

- **S6 — Back/Forward.** *Expected: preserved.* Navigate `/` → `/tab-scoped-route` via the SideNav,
  then use the browser's **Back** then **Forward** buttons. The `/` `Value` should be unchanged on
  return.

- **S7 — Cross-origin hop.** *Expected: preserved on Back.* In the same tab, type
  `https://example.com` in the address bar and go; then press **Back** to return to the app.
  Browsers clear `window.name` on cross-origin navigation for security and may or may not restore it
  on Back — this row measures that. A new scope here is a real finding.

- **S8 — Duplicate Tab (human only).** *Expected: new scope — the duplicate must get a fresh
  `window.name`.* Right-click the tab → **Duplicate**. Confirm the new tab shows a **different**
  Browser tab ID + `Value` and logs its own `Created TabScope{…}`. **If instead it shows the same ID
  with no new `Created`**, the two tabs have collided on one `TabScope` (shared `Value`, and a
  `@TabScoped` instance would be yanked between the two live UIs — the "Can't move a node from one
  state tree to another" hazard the instantiator exists to prevent) — a real isolation failure;
  record as `fails`. Observed new-scope on Chromium 150 and LibreWolf 149.

- **S9 — `target=_blank`.** *Expected: new scope.* From the console run
  `window.open('http://localhost:8080/tab-scoped-route')` (or any link opening a new tab). The new
  tab should get a **fresh** `window.name` → new scope. Confirms new tabs aren't mis-merged.

- **S10 — Reopen closed tab.** *Expected: new scope.* Close the tab, then **Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-T**. Per
  INTERNALS, reopening does **not** preserve `window.name`; expect a new scope, and (~60 s after the
  original close) a `Destroying` for the old name.

- **S11 — Restore-after-quit.** *Expected: undefined — measure.* Configure the browser to reopen
  windows/tabs on launch (Chrome: "Continue where you left off"; Safari: reopen all windows). Fully
  **quit** and relaunch the browser. Record whether the restored tab keeps its ID/`Value`.

- **S12 — Restore-after-crash.** *Expected: undefined — measure.* Force-kill the browser process (so
  the crash-restore prompt appears), relaunch, choose **Restore**. Record ID/`Value`.

- **S13 — bfcache restore.** *Expected: preserved.* Navigate away via a same-tab link to another
  same-origin page, then press **Back** so the page is restored from the back/forward cache (no full
  reload). A reset here means bfcache restore re-runs bootstrap with a lost name.

- **S14 — `@PreserveOnRefresh` F5.** *Expected: preserved, no reset.* Open `/preserve`, note
  `Value`, press **F5**. The same `Value` should show (the DOM is preserved and the scope survives).
  Isolates the preserve path from the plain-route path in S1.

> **S2b / S3 and Safari.** These two human-only rows are expected to **pass on Chrome, Firefox and
> Edge** (`window.name` preserved) and to **fail on Safari** — Safari 18.3.1 with Web Inspector
> *closed* was observed to drop `window.name` on an address-bar/bookmark reload. That drop is a
> genuine failure of the tab-identity guarantee (a spurious destroy follows ~60 s later), so **on
> Safari record S2b/S3 as `fails`** with the note "expected — this is how Safari works". It is not a
> bug in this library and there is no server-side fix (see §5); recording it as a failure — rather
> than quietly excusing it — is what keeps Safari's column in the outcome tables honest.
>
> **S2a** is the automation-only counterpart: the *programmatic* same-URL reload
> (`page.goto(location.href)`). It preserves `window.name` on every browser including Safari, so it
> is expected to **pass everywhere** and does not surface the Safari drop — that is what S2b is for.

### Safari-specific: Web Inspector modifier

For **every** Safari row (B4), run it **twice**: once with **Web Inspector closed**, once with it
**open** (Develop → Show Web Inspector). Safari 18.3.1 was observed to preserve `window.name` when
the Inspector is open but drop it (S2b/S3) when closed — so testing only with DevTools open would
*hide* the very bug. Record both in the "closed / open" cell.

---

## 4. Interpreting a failure

When a "preserved"-expected row shows ⚠️:
- **Signal A** (`Browser tab ID`) changes → the browser handed the server a different `window.name`.
- **Signal B** (`Value`) jumps → tab-scoped state silently reset mid-session.
- **Signal C** logs `Created TabScope{<new>}` at once, then `Destroying TabScope{<old>}` ~60 s later
  → the **spurious destroy**: a `addDestroyListener` consumer (e.g. swing-on-vaadin mapping
  tab-close → app shutdown) would tear down as if the tab had closed. This delayed destroy is the
  concrete false-positive to document per browser/action.

---

## 5. Mitigation notes (record findings)

- **No server-side fix.** The server only sees the `window.name` the browser sends; if the browser
  drops it, the two navigations are indistinguishable from close-then-new-tab. State this explicitly
  in README as an inherent limitation for any confirmed ⚠️ row.
- **Possible client-side probe (to evaluate, not yet built):** mirror `window.name` into
  `sessionStorage` (which *is* tab-scoped and survives reload) and, on bootstrap, if `window.name`
  is empty but `sessionStorage` holds a prior name, restore it before Vaadin reads it. This could
  recover S2b/S3 losses. Note whether `sessionStorage` itself survives each failing scenario (it does
  **not** survive S9/S10/new-tab, which is correct). If evaluated, capture the result here.
- Otherwise record **"no known mitigation — inherent limitation"** for the confirmed rows, as the
  issue permits.

# Last Testing Outcome

_Chrome: automated (headless) partial pass on 2026-07-22, below. All other chapters are still
templates awaiting a real run._

## Chrome (Chromium 150.0.7871.114, headless via Playwright MCP) — 2026-07-22

> Mostly an automated (headless) pass; **S8 was hand-driven** (Duplicate Tab in a headed session,
> tabs then examined via Playwright). Rows left blank were not exercised — S2b/S3/S10–S12 are not
> scriptable (see §1 "Automating a pass"); S4/S5/S6/S9/S13 simply weren't run this time. As noted in
> §1, headless Chrome preserves `window.name` across every scriptable navigation, so the automated
> rows confirm the happy path but cannot surface a name drop.
